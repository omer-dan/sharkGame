# sharkGame
This is the code for our Shark game, as part of the Nand2Tetris course. 
You can compile the code in the nand2tetris online IDE on https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/compiler and then run it (Make sure to adjust the execution speed to 3/4 (default is 1/2).

Feel free to use this code as a base for your projects :)
